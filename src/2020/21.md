```
mxmxvkd kfcds sqjhc nhms (contains dairy, fish)
trh fvjkl sbzzf mxmxvkd (contains dairy)
sqjhc fvjkl (contains soy)
sqjhc mxmxvkd sbzzf (contains fish)
```

Create a BiMap of ingredients and allergen. So after the first line is done, the
bimap will have

```
[
  {mxmxvkd, dairy},
  {mxmxvkd, fish},
  {kfcds, dairy},
  {kfcds, fish},
  {sqjhc, dairy},
  {sqjhc, fish},
  {nhms, dairy},
  {nhms, fish},
]
```

You get to the second row. You check if any of any of `trh, fvjkl, sbzzf, mxmxvkd` are already in `bimap.getValues('dairy')`. If

1. Only one ingredient from the line is in `bimap.getKeys('dairy')`, then we can
   remove every ingredient except `mxmxvkd` from it, and make sure
   `bimap.getValues('mxmxvkd')` is a singleton `['dairy']`. So in our case, we'd
   remove `{mxmxvkd, fish}`.
2. If multiple ingredients have `dairy` already in their list, then do nothing
   with that allergen and move on to the next allergen.
3. If no ingredient has the `dairy` allergen, add it to all the ingrdients like
   we did earlier.

Maybe also hold a set of resolved ingredients and a set of allergens.
