# Day 7 - Handy Haversacks - [PartA](7.ts) [Part B](7b.ts)

Hand bags must follow a certain rule. E.g.:

```
light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
faded blue bags contain no other bags.
dotted black bags contain no other bags.
```

## Part A

You have a **shiny gold** bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag?

In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:

- A `bright white` bag, which can hold your `shiny gold` bag directly.
- A `muted yellow` bag, which can hold your `shiny gold` bag directly, plus some other bags.
- A `dark orange` bag, which can hold `bright white` and `muted yellow` bags, either of which could then hold your `shiny gold` bag.
- A `light red` bag, which can hold `bright white` and `muted yellow` bags, either of which could then hold your `shiny gold` bag.

So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one `shiny gold` bag is **4**.

**How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag?**

## Part B

How many bags can your `shiny gold` bag contain in itself? In the example above,
the answer is **32**:

- `faded blue` bags contain 0 other bags.
- `dotted black` bags contain 0 other bags.
- `vibrant plum` bags contain 11 other bags: 5 `faded blue` bags and 6 `dotted black` bags.
- `dark olive` bags contain 7 other bags: 3 `faded blue` bags and 4 `dotted black` bags.

So, a single `shiny gold` bag must contain 1 `dark olive` bag (and the 7 bags within it) plus 2 `vibrant plum` bags (and the 11 bags within each of those): `1 + 1*7 + 2 + 2*11 = 32 bags!`

Another example:

```
shiny gold bags contain 2 dark red bags.
dark red bags contain 2 dark orange bags.
dark orange bags contain 2 dark yellow bags.
dark yellow bags contain 2 dark green bags.
dark green bags contain 2 dark blue bags.
dark blue bags contain 2 dark violet bags.
dark violet bags contain no other bags.
```

In this example, a single `shiny gold` bag must contain **126** other bags.

# Solutions

## Part A

The weights on this part of the problem does not matter. We create a Graph with
edges going from `shiny gold` bag, and then find all the nodes that the `shiny gold` bag can reach. E.g., the following line

```
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
```

Would create the following edges:

```
shinyGold -> mutedYellow
fadedBlue -> mutedYellow
```

The solution then is:

```typescript
/**
 * Given a node 'target', find all the nodes that we can reach from target.
 */
function connectedNodesCount({ target, graph }: Simulation): number {
  if (graph.getAdjList(target).length === 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  const helper = (node: string, visited: Set<string>): number => {
    // We don't want double-count, so if node has already been accounted for,
    // give it a count of 0 now.
    if (visited.has(node)) {
      return 0;
    }
    visited.add(node);
    const adjList = graph.getAdjList(node);
    let count = 1;
    for (const neighbor of adjList) {
      count += helper(neighbor, visited);
    }
    return count;
  };
  // the node we start with is included in the count, so take that out by
  // subtracting 1.
  return helper(target, new Set()) - 1;
}
```

## Part B

We do care about the weights now, and now we're interested on the out-degree of
`shiny gold` bag. Thus, we tranpose our graph from part A. E.g., the following line

```
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
```

Would create the following edges:

````
mutedYellow -> 2 shinyGold
mutedYellow -> 9 fadedBlue
`

The solution is:

```typescript
/**
 * From a given target, do a DFS search to all leaves to get sum of bags it all
 * contains.
 * So if bag X contains 4 A and 2 B, bag X contains at least 6 bags, plus however
 * many bags A can contain in itself and however many bags B can contain in
 * itself.
 */
function getTotalBagsFrom({ target, graph }: Simulation): number {
  if (graph.getAdjList(target).length === 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  const helper = (node: string, cache: Map<string, number>): number => {
    if (cache.has(node)) {
      return cache.get(node)!;
    }
    let totalBags = 0;
    for (const neighbor of graph.getAdjList(node)) {
      const weight = graph.getWeight(node, neighbor) ?? 1;
      totalBags += weight + weight * helper(neighbor, cache);
    }
    cache.set(node, totalBags);
    return totalBags;
  };
  return helper(target, new Map());
}
