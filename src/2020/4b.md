# Day 4: Passport Processing - [Part 2](4b.ts)

The automatic passport scanners are slow because they're having trouble detecting which passports have all required fields. The expected fields are as follows:

- `byr` (Birth Year) - four digits; at least 1920 and at most 2002.
- `iyr` (Issue Year) - four digits; at least 2010 and at most 2020.
- `eyr` (Expiration Year) - four digits; at least 2020 and at most 2030.
- `hgt` (Height) - a number followed by either cm or in:
  - If `cm`, the number must be at least 150 and at most 193.
  - If `in`, the number must be at least 59 and at most 76.
- `hcl` (Hair Color) - a `#` followed by exactly six characters `0-9` or `a-f`.
- `ecl` (Eye Color) - exactly one of: `amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth`.
- `pid` (Passport ID) - a nine-digit number, including leading zeroes.
- `cid` (Country ID) - ignored, missing or not.

Your input example:

```
ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm

iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929

hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
eyr:2024
ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
hgt:179cm

hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in
```

You ignore the `cid` field because your passport does not have it to begin with. Your job is to count the passports where all required fields are both **present** and **valid** according to the above rules.

In your batch file, how many passports are valid?

## Solution

The Rules Design Pattern from [here](http://www.michael-whelan.net/rules-design-pattern/) came in
handy. I created a base interface:

```typescript
interface Rule {
  isValid(passport: Passport): boolean;
}
```

and created several rules off of that. I also created an `And` rule for composition:

```typescript
class AndRule implements Rule {
  constructor(private readonly rules: Rule[]) {}

  isValid(passport: Passport) {
    return this.rules.every((r) => r.isValid(passport));
  }
}

function and(...rules: Rule[]): Rule {
  return new AndRule(rules);
}
```

This allowed me to create all the rules like such:

```typescript
and(
  new BirthYearRule(),
  new IssueYearRule(),
  new ExpirationYearRule(),
  new HeightRule(),
  new HairColorRule(),
  new EyeColorRule(),
  new PassportIdRule()
);
```
