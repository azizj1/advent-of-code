# Day 13 - Shuttle Search - [Part 2](13b.ts)

You're given a bus schedule like such:

```
7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19
```

Which means:

- Bus ID `7` arrives at time `t`. It repeats every `7t`'s. So It'll arrive again
  at `t + 7`, and `t + 14`, and so on. **All buses repeat based on their ID.**
- Bus ID `13` arrives at `t + 1`. Just like `7`, this would repeat every `13t`. So
  `t + 14`, `t + 27`, etc.
- Bus ID `59` arrives at `t + 4`.
- Bus ID `31` arrives at `t + 6`.
- Bus ID `19` arrives at `t + 7`.

The `x` are bus schedules as well, but they don't have any constraint on the
problem we're going to give.

We're trying to figure out the **smallest value of `t` that satisfies the
schedule above.**

In this example, the earliest timestamp at which this occurs is **1068781**:

The fact that bus `7` and bus `19` both depart at the same time at the very end
is not relevant. Just a coindence for this example.

Here are some other examples:

- The earliest timestamp that matches the list `17,x,13,19` is `3417`.
- `67,7,59,61` first occurs at timestamp `754018.`
- `67,x,7,59,61` first occurs at timestamp `779210`.
- `67,7,x,59,61` first occurs at timestamp `1261476`.
- `1789,37,47,1889` first occurs at timestamp `1202161486`.

**What is the earliest timestamp such that all of the listed bus IDs depart at
offsets matching their positions in the list?**

## Solution

One solution is to just find the largest number in our bus schedule, and make sure `t - idx` is divisible by that large number, where `idx` is the index where the largest number is in the array. Whenever we increment `t`, we increment by that largest number, because `t` always has to be divisible by the largest number. In this scenario, our `step` is `largest number`.

```typescript
export function getEarliestTimestamp({ busSchedule }: Simulation) {
  const [maxNumId, maxNum] = busSchedule.reduce(
    (max, curr, idx) => (curr > max[1] ? [idx, curr] : max),
    [-1, 0]
  );

  // Say the max number is at index 4, and it's 97.
  // Say the first number is 13 (at index 0 obv).
  // Any timestamp we have must be divisible by 97, which allows us to use that
  // as our increment (see end of while loop) below.
  // We start our timestamp at maxNum - maxNumId (or 93) because we'll add idx
  // back to it in the if statement inside for-loop. So it'll be checking if 93
  // + 4 + 97x is divisible by 97 when it gets to 97, which must always be true.
  let timestamp = maxNum - maxNumId;
  while (timestamp < Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) {
    let solutionFound = true;
    for (let i = 0; i < busSchedule.length; i++) {
      if (isNaN(busSchedule[i])) {
        continue;
      }
      if ((timestamp + i) % busSchedule[i] !== 0) {
        solutionFound = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (solutionFound) {
      break;
    }
    timestamp += maxNum;
  }
  return timestamp;
}
```

This solution took 50mins to solve the input given.

### Better Solution (took single-digit milliseconds)

Say our input is `[7, 13, 19, 23]`.

1. Set our step to `7` and timestamp to `7` (because it's the first element in
   the array). **Whenever we change timestamp, it must ALWAYS be divisible by 7.** So we add by `7` or some multiple of `7`. E.g., `step += 7`, or `step += 7*4`.
2. Start a for-loop, iterating over the rest of the elements in our array `13, 19, 23`.
   - In each iteration of this for-loop, add `step` (`7` atm) to the `timestamp` until `timestamp + 1` is divisible by `13`.
   - Once we do find such a number, we need to make sure `timestamp + 1`
     continues to stay divisible by `13`. In our `step` now, we need to add `13` to it always or some multiple of `13`.
   - But we also need to make sure `timestamp` stays divisible by `7`.
   - We can solve both of these problems by making our **`step = 7 * 13`**. Recall
     that as long as we add `7` or some multiple of `7`, we're good. That
     multiple is `13`. Likewise, as long as we add `13` or some multiple of
     `13`, we're good. That multiple is `7`.
   - Now we increase the `timestamp` by `7 * 13`, which is a much bigger
     number!
   - As soon as we find a `timestamp` that causes `timestamp + 2` to be
     divisible by `19`, we can increase our step to `step = 7 * 13 * 19`,
     making our loop even faster.

```typescript
export function getEarliestTimestamp({ busSchedule }: Simulation) {
  let timestamp = busSchedule[0];
  let step = busSchedule[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < busSchedule.length; i++) {
    if (isNaN(busSchedule[i])) {
      continue;
    }
    while ((timestamp + i) % busSchedule[i] !== 0) {
      timestamp += step;
    }
    step = step * busSchedule[i];
  }
  return timestamp;
}
```

This took a handful of milliseconds to solve the input, as opposed to 50 minutes
like the previous one.
