# Day 24 Part Two - [Code](24b.ts)
After careful analysis, one thing is certain: you have no idea where all these bugs are coming from.

Then, you remember: Eris is an old Plutonian settlement! Clearly, the bugs are coming from recursively-folded space.

This 5x5 grid is **only one** level in an **infinite** number of recursion levels. The tile in the middle of the grid is actually another 5x5 grid, the grid in your scan is contained as the middle tile of a larger 5x5 grid, and so on. Two levels of grids look like this:
```

     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     | | | | | |     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
     |     | | | | | |     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
     |     | | |?| | |     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
     |     | | | | | |     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
     |     | | | | | |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
```

(To save space, some of the tiles are not drawn to scale.) Remember, this is only a small part of the infinitely recursive grid; there is a 5x5 grid that contains this diagram, and a 5x5 grid that contains that one, and so on. Also, the ? in the diagram contains another 5x5 grid, which itself contains another 5x5 grid, and so on.

The scan you took (your puzzle input) shows where the bugs are **on a single level** of this structure. The middle tile of your scan is empty to accommodate the recursive grids within it. Initially, no other levels contain bugs.

Tiles still count as **adjacent** if they are directly **up, down, left, or right** of a given tile. Some tiles have adjacent tiles at a recursion level above or below its own level. For example:

```
     |     |         |     |     
  1  |  2  |    3    |  4  |  5  
     |     |         |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     |         |     |     
  6  |  7  |    8    |  9  |  10 
     |     |         |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     |A|B|C|D|E|     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
     |     |F|G|H|I|J|     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
 11  | 12  |K|L|?|N|O|  14 |  15 
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
     |     |P|Q|R|S|T|     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
     |     |U|V|W|X|Y|     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     |         |     |     
 16  | 17  |    18   |  19 |  20 
     |     |         |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     |         |     |     
 21  | 22  |    23   |  24 |  25 
     |     |         |     |     
```

* Tile 19 has four adjacent tiles: 14, 18, 20, and 24.
* Tile G has four adjacent tiles: B, F, H, and L.
* Tile D has four adjacent tiles: 8, C, E, and I.
* Tile E has four adjacent tiles: 8, D, 14, and J.
* Tile 14 has **eight** adjacent tiles: 9, E, J, O, T, Y, 15, and 19.
* Tile N has **eight** adjacent tiles: I, O, S, and five tiles within the sub-grid marked ?.
The rules about bugs living and dying are the same as before.

For example, consider the same initial state as above:
```
....#
#..#.
#.?##
..#..
#....
```

The center tile is drawn as ? to indicate the next recursive grid. Call this level 0; the grid within this one is level 1, and the grid that contains this one is level -1. Then, after **ten** minutes, the grid at each level would look like this:
```
Depth -5:
..#..
.#.#.
..?.#
.#.#.
..#..

Depth -4:
...#.
...##
..?..
...##
...#.

Depth -3:
#.#..
.#...
..?..
.#...
#.#..

Depth -2:
.#.##
....#
..?.#
...##
.###.

Depth -1:
#..##
...##
..?..
...#.
.####

Depth 0:
.#...
.#.##
.#?..
.....
.....

Depth 1:
.##..
#..##
..?.#
##.##
#####

Depth 2:
###..
##.#.
#.?..
.#.##
#.#..

Depth 3:
..###
.....
#.?..
#....
#...#

Depth 4:
.###.
#..#.
#.?..
##.#.
.....

Depth 5:
####.
#..#.
#.?#.
####.
.....
```
In this example, after 10 minutes, a total of **`99`** bugs are present.

Starting with your scan, **how many bugs are present after 200 minutes**?

Your puzzle answer was `2109`.

## Solution
There's actually not much recursion involved in the solution:
* Maintain an array of `grids`, where `grids[0]` is the inner-most grid thus far, and `grids[grids.length - 1]` is the outer-most grid thus far.
    * Initially, `grids = [initialGrid]`
* For every minute,
    * go through every level, starting from the *inner-most* level, updating its bugs and empty spaces by looking at the grid right below and above it.
    * Once you're done going through every level,
        * Check if the inner-most level (`grids[0]`) has any bugs at the inner circle where a level below the inner-most level would develop bugs. I.e.,
            ```
            00000
            00100
            01?10
            00100
            00000
            ```
            If there's any bugs where the `1`s are at, then there will be a **new inner-most** level that you need to evaluate the bug-life on in the same minute. 
        * Check if the outer-most level (`grids[grids.length - 1]`) has any bugs at the outer circle where a level above the outer-most level would develop bugs. I.e.,
            ```
            11111
            10001
            10001
            10001
            11111
            ```
            If there's any bugs where the `1`s are at, then there will be a **new outer-most** level that you need to evaluate the bug-life on in the same minute.


Ignoring the *how to get number of neighboring bugs*, here's the gist of the code:

```typescript
const afterOneMinuteAtLvl = (grid: number, getNumOfAdjBugs: (index: number) => number) => {
    let working = grid;
    const hasBugAt = makeHasBugAt(grid);
    for (let i = 0; i < sideLength * sideLength; i++) {
        if (i === 12) // if at center
            continue;
        const adjBugs = getNumOfAdjBugs(i);
        if (hasBugAt(i) && adjBugs !== 1)
            working = kill(working, i);
        else if (!hasBugAt(i) && (adjBugs === 1 || adjBugs === 2))
            working = infest(working, i);
    }
    return working;
};

const afterOneMinute = (grids: number[]) => {
    const working = [...grids];
    const getNumberOfAdjBugs = makeGetNumberOfAdjBugsPlutonian(grids);
    for (let i = 0; i < grids.length; i++)
        working[i] = afterOneMinuteAtLvl(grids[i], getNumberOfAdjBugs(i));

    if (hasBugsAtInnerLvl(first(grids)))
        working.unshift(afterOneMinuteAtLvl(0, getNumberOfAdjBugs(-1)));
    if (hasBugsAtOuterLvl(last(grids)))
        working.push(afterOneMinuteAtLvl(0, getNumberOfAdjBugs(grids.length)));
    return working;
};

// counts the number of bits in grid
const toNumberOfBugs = (grid: number) => {
    let count = 0,
        leftoverGrid = grid;
    for (; leftoverGrid > 0; leftoverGrid >>= 1) // Equiv to leftoverGrid = leftOverGrid >> 1
        count += leftoverGrid & 1;
    return count;
};

export const bugsAfterXMinutes = (initGrid: number) => (mins: number) => {
    let grids = [initGrid];
    for (let i = 0; i < mins; i++) {
        grids = afterOneMinute(grids);
    }
    return grids.map(toNumberOfBugs).reduce((a, c) => a + c, 0);
};
```

### Getting Number of Adjacent Bugs
Some bit masking and storing of which index around `?` map to the indices of the inner grid.

```typescript
/*
00000
00100
01?10
00100
00000
*/
const adjToInnerMask = 0b100010100010000000;
const hasBugsAtInnerLvl = (grid: number) => (grid & adjToInnerMask) > 0;

/*
11111
10001
10001
10001
11111
*/
const perimeterMask = 0b1111110001100011000111111;
const hasBugsAtOuterLvl = (grid: number) => (grid & perimeterMask) > 0;

const isAdjToInner = (index: number) => ((1 << index) & adjToInnerMask) > 0;
const isAdjToOuter = (index: number) => ((1 << index) & perimeterMask) > 0;

const indexToInnerAdjIndices = new Map([
    [7, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]], // above ?
    [11, [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]], // left of ?
    [13, [4, 9, 14, 19, 24]], // right of ?
    [17, [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]] // below ?
]);

// inverse of indexToInnerAdjIndices, i.e.,
// 0 -> [7, 11]
// 1 -> [7]
// 4 -> [7, 13]
// etc.
const indexToOuterAdjIndices = Array.from(indexToInnerAdjIndices.entries()).map(([k, vs]) => vs.map(v => ({k, v})))
    .reduce((a, c) => a.concat(c), [] as {k: number; v: number}[])
    .reduce((m, e) => {
        const arr = m.get(e.v) ?? [];
        arr.push(e.k);
        return m.set(e.v, arr);
    }, new Map<number, number[]>());

const makeGetNumberOfAdjBugsPlutonian =
    (grids: number[]) => // 0th grid is inner-most
    (level: number) => // current level
    (index: number) => // info about index's neighbors at level
{
    const grid = grids[level] ?? 0;
    const innerGrid = grids[level - 1] ?? 0;
    const outerGrid = grids[level + 1] ?? 0;
    let count = makeGetNumberOfAdjBugs(grid)(index);

    if (innerGrid > 0 && isAdjToInner(index))
        count += indexToInnerAdjIndices.get(index)?.map(makeBugAt(innerGrid)).reduce((a, c) => a + c, 0) ?? 0;
    if (outerGrid > 0 && isAdjToOuter(index))
        count += indexToOuterAdjIndices.get(index)?.map(makeBugAt(outerGrid)).reduce((a, c) => a + c, 0) ?? 0;
    return count;
};
```
