# Day 20 - Donut Maze - [Code](20.ts)
You notice a strange pattern on the surface of Pluto and land nearby to get a closer look. Upon closer inspection, you realize you've come across one of the famous space-warping mazes of the long-lost Pluto civilization!

Because there isn't much space on Pluto, the civilization that used to live here thrived by inventing a method for folding spacetime. Although the technology is no longer understood, mazes like this one provide a small glimpse into the daily life of an ancient Pluto citizen.

This maze is shaped like a donut. Portals along the inner and outer edge of the donut can instantly teleport you from one side to the other. For example:
```
         A           
         A           
  #######.#########  
  #######.........#  
  #######.#######.#  
  #######.#######.#  
  #######.#######.#  
  #####  B    ###.#  
BC...##  C    ###.#  
  ##.##       ###.#  
  ##...DE  F  ###.#  
  #####    G  ###.#  
  #########.#####.#  
DE..#######...###.#  
  #.#########.###.#  
FG..#########.....#  
  ###########.#####  
             Z       
             Z       
```

This map of the maze shows solid walls (`#`) and open passages (`.`). Every maze on Pluto has a start (the open tile next to `AA`) and an end (the open tile next to `ZZ`). Mazes on Pluto also have portals; this maze has three pairs of portals: `BC`, `DE`, and `FG`. When on an open tile next to one of these labels, a single step can take you to the other tile with the same label. (You can only walk on `.` tiles; labels and empty space are not traversable.)

One path through the maze doesn't require any portals. Starting at `AA`, you could go down `1`, right `8`, down `12`, left `4`, and down `1` to reach `ZZ`, a total of `26` steps.

However, there is a shorter path: You could walk from AA to the inner `BC` portal (`4` steps), warp to the outer `BC` portal (`1` step), walk to the inner `DE` (`6` steps), warp to the outer `DE` (`1` step), walk to the outer `FG` (`4` steps), warp to the inner `FG` (`1` step), and finally walk to `ZZ` (`6` steps). In total, this is only `23` steps.

Here is a larger example:
```
                   A               
                   A

```
Here, AA has no direct path to ZZ, but it does connect to `AS` and `CP`. By passing through `AS`, `QG`, `BU`, and `JO`, you can reach `ZZ` in `58` steps.

In your maze, **how many steps does it take to get from the open tile marked AA to the open tile marked ZZ**?

Your puzzle answer was 608.

## Solution
Straightforward Dijkstra's algorithm. Only thing unique is the input conversion, which we'll get to at the end. Here's the gist of the code:

**Note**: Ignore all references about `isInner`. That's a concept for [problem 20b](20b.md).

```typescript
export interface IMaze {
    name: string;
    grid: string[][];
    entrance: IPoint;
    exit: IPoint;
    portals: Map<string, [IPoint, IPoint] | [IPoint]>;
    portalLocations: Map<string, {key: string; isInner: boolean}>; // key is IPoint in toString()
}

export const entranceKey = 'AA';
export const exitKey = 'ZZ';

const toGraph = ({entrance, exit, grid, portals, portalLocations}: IMaze) => {
    const graph = new WGraph<string, number>();
    const queue = new PriorityQueue<{at: IPoint; lastPortal: string; steps: number}>(p => -1 * p.steps);
    const visited = new Map<string, number>(); // IPoint -> distance from entrance
    const isValid = makeIsValid(grid, entrance);
    queue.enqueue({at: entrance, steps: 0, lastPortal: entranceKey});
    visited.set(toKey(entrance), 0);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        const { at, steps, lastPortal } = queue.dequeue()!;
        if (equals(at, exit))
            break; // done
        // we don't check visited here because we may want to revisit a visited node if the steps are shorter
        // neighbors are reachable dots (.), some of which may be portals
        const neighbors = getNeighbors(at).filter(isValid);
        for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
            const neighborStr = toKey(neighbor);
            const newSteps = steps + 1;

            if (!visited.has(neighborStr) || visited.get(neighborStr)! > newSteps) {
                const neighborAtPortal = portalLocations.get(neighborStr);

                if (neighborAtPortal != null) {
                    const neighborPortalName = neighborAtPortal.key;
                    if (neighborPortalName === lastPortal)
                        continue;

                    const portalTo = first(portals.get(neighborPortalName)!.filter(p => !equals(p, neighbor)));
                    queue.enqueue({
                        at: portalTo ?? neighbor, // possible if portal === 'ZZ'
                        lastPortal: neighborPortalName,
                        steps: newSteps + 1
                    });
                    graph.addDirectedEdge(lastPortal, neighborPortalName, newSteps);
                    visited.set(toKey(portalTo), newSteps);
                }
                else {
                    queue.enqueue({
                        at: neighbor,
                        lastPortal: lastPortal,
                        steps: newSteps
                    });
                }
                visited.set(neighborStr, newSteps);
            }
        }

    }
    return graph;
};

export const run = () => {
    const sims = getSimulations();
    for (const s of sims) {
        console.log(timer.start(`20 - ${s.name}`));
        const graph = toGraph(s);
        console.log(graph.toString(n => n?.toString() ?? ''));
        console.log(timer.stop());
    }
};

```

The auxiliary method to convert the graph into an `IMaze` is as follows (ignore the `isInner` stuff):

```typescript
// when it lands on a dot (.), it checks if the two squares in direction X are both letters.
//  If letters, then we know the dot (.) is a portal.
const toMaze = ({name, grid}: {name: string; grid: string[][]}): IMaze => {
    const isInner = makeIsInner(grid);
    const getKey = (i: number, j: number) => {
        if (/^[A-Z]$/.test(grid[i - 1]?.[j]) && grid[i - 2]?.[j] === '.')
            return {
                key: grid[i - 1][j] + grid[i][j],
                forPoint: { col: j, row: i - 2 },
                isInner: isInner(i - 2, j, true)
            };
        if (/^[A-Z]$/.test(grid[i + 1]?.[j]) && grid[i + 2]?.[j] === '.')
            return {
                key: grid[i][j] + grid[i + 1][j],
                forPoint: { col: j, row: i + 2 },
                isInner: isInner(i + 2, j, true)
            };

        if (/^[A-Z]$/.test(grid[i]?.[j - 1]) && grid[i]?.[j - 2] === '.')
            return {
                key: grid[i][j - 1] + grid[i][j],
                forPoint: { col: j - 2, row: i },
                isInner: isInner(i, j - 2, false)
            };
        if (/^[A-Z]$/.test(grid[i]?.[j + 1]) && grid[i]?.[j + 2] === '.')
            return {
                key: grid[i][j] + grid[i][j + 1],
                forPoint: { col: j + 2, row: i },
                isInner: isInner(i, j + 2, false)
            };
        return { key: null, forPoint: null, isInner: false };
    };
    const portals = new Map<string, [IPoint, IPoint] | [IPoint]>();
    const portalLocations = new Map<string, {key: string; isInner: boolean}>();

    for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
            if (!/^[A-Z]$/.test(grid[i]?.[j]))
                continue;
            const { key, forPoint, isInner } = getKey(i, j);
            if (key == null || forPoint == null)
                continue;
            portalLocations.set(toKey(forPoint), {key, isInner});
            if (portals.has(key))
                portals.get(key)!.push(forPoint);
            else
                portals.set(key, [forPoint]);
        }
    }
    return {
        name,
        grid,
        portals,
        portalLocations,
        entrance: first(portals.get(entranceKey)!),
        exit: first(portals.get(exitKey)!)
    };
};
```
