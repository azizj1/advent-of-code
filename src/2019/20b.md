# Day 20b Part Two - [Code](20b.ts)
Strangely, the exit isn't open when you reach it. Then, you remember: the ancient Plutonians were famous for building **recursive spaces**.

The marked connections in the maze aren't portals: they **physically connect** to a larger or smaller copy of the maze. Specifically, the labeled tiles around the inside edge actually connect to a smaller copy of the same maze, and the smaller copy's inner labeled tiles connect to yet a **smaller** copy, and so on.

When you enter the maze, you are at the outermost level; when at the outermost level, only the outer labels `AA` and `ZZ` function (as the start and end, respectively); all other outer labeled tiles are effectively walls. At any other level, `AA` and `ZZ` count as walls, but the other outer labeled tiles bring you one level outward.

Your goal is to find a path through the maze that brings you back to `ZZ` at the outermost level of the maze.

In the first example (in [part 1](20.md)), the shortest path is now the loop around the right side. If the starting level is `0`, then taking the previously-shortest path would pass through `BC` (to level `1`), `DE` (to level `2`), and `FG` (back to level `1`). Because this is not the outermost level, `ZZ` is a wall, and the only option is to go back around to `BC`, which would only send you even deeper into the recursive maze.

In the second example above, there is no path that brings you to `ZZ` at the outermost level.

Here is a more interesting example:
```

             Z P Q B       K

This path takes a total of `396` steps to move from `AA` at the outermost layer to `ZZ` at the outermost layer.

In your maze, when accounting for recursion, **how many steps does it take to get from the open tile marked AA to the open tile marked ZZ, both at the outermost layer**?

## Solution

The code builds off of the code in [part 1](20.md):

```typescript
// same as part 1 - only added to improve readability for this markdown.
interface IMaze {
    name: string;
    grid: string[][];
    entrance: IPoint;
    exit: IPoint;
    portals: Map<string, [IPoint, IPoint] | [IPoint]>;
    portalLocations: Map<string, {key: string; isInner: boolean}>; // key is IPoint in toString()
}

const toGraph = ({entrance, exit, grid, portals, portalLocations}: IMaze) => {
    const graph = new WGraph<string, number>(); // weight is steps between portals
    const queue = new PriorityQueue<{at: IPoint; lastPortal: string; steps: number; level: number}>(p => -1 * p.steps);
    const visited = new Map<string, number>(); // IPoint,level -> distance from entrance
    const isValid = makeIsValid(grid, entrance);

    queue.enqueue({at: entrance, steps: 0, lastPortal: entranceKey, level: 0});
    visited.set(toKey(entrance) + '|0', 0); // visited is now key|level

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        const { at, steps, lastPortal, level } = queue.dequeue()!;
        if (equals(at, exit) && level === -1) // Z is at level 0, and it'll do level - 1 = -1
            break; // done

        const neighbors = getNeighbors(at).filter(isValid);
        for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
            const neighborStr = toKey(neighbor);
            const newSteps = steps + 1;
            const visitedKey = neighborStr + '|' + level;

            if (!visited.has(visitedKey) || visited.get(visitedKey)! > newSteps) {
                const neighborAtPortal = portalLocations.get(neighborStr);

                if (neighborAtPortal != null) {
                    const neighborPortalName = neighborAtPortal.key;
                    if (neighborPortalName === lastPortal)
                        continue;

                    const portalTo = first(portals.get(neighborPortalName)!.filter(p => !equals(p, neighbor)));
                    const newLevel = neighborAtPortal.isInner ? level + 1 : level - 1;

                    if ((neighborPortalName === entranceKey || neighborPortalName === exitKey) && level !== 0) {
                        visited.set(visitedKey, newSteps);
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (!neighborAtPortal.isInner && level === 0 && neighborPortalName !== exitKey) {
                        visited.set(visitedKey, newSteps);
                        continue;
                    }

                    queue.enqueue({
                        at: portalTo ?? neighbor, // possible if portal === 'ZZ'
                        lastPortal: neighborPortalName,
                        steps: newSteps + 1,
                        level: newLevel
                    });
                    graph.addDirectedEdge(lastPortal, neighborPortalName, newSteps);
                    visited.set(toKey(portalTo) + '|' + newLevel, newSteps);
                }
                else {
                    queue.enqueue({
                        at: neighbor,
                        lastPortal: lastPortal,
                        steps: newSteps,
                        level
                    });
                }
                visited.set(visitedKey, newSteps);
            }
        }

    }
    return graph;
};
```

And the inner part isn't anything fancy. It just guestimates what the borders are for outer/inner:

```typescript
const makeIsInner = (grid: string[][]) => (row: number, col: number, verticalChange: boolean) => {
    if (verticalChange) {
        if (row < 5 || row > grid.length - 5)
            return false;
        return true;
    }
    if (col < 5 || col > grid[row].length - 5)
        return false;
    return true;
};
```
