# Day 18: Many-Worlds Interpretation Part 2 - [Code](18b.ts)

You arrive at the vault only to discover that there is not one vault, but four - each with its own entrance.

On your map, find the area in the middle that looks like this:
```
...
.@.
...
```

Update your map to instead use the correct data:
```
@#@
###
@#@
```
This change will split your map into four separate sections, each with its own entrance:
```
#######       #######
#a.#Cd#       #a.#Cd#
##...##       ##@#@##
##.@.##  -->  #######
##...##       ##@#@##
#cB#Ab#       #cB#Ab#
#######       #######
```

Because some of the keys are for doors in other vaults, it would take much too long to collect all of the keys by yourself. Instead, you deploy four remote-controlled robots. Each starts at one of the entrances (`@`).

Your goal is still to `collect all of the keys in the fewest steps`, but now, each robot has its own position and can move independently. You can only remotely control a single robot at a time. Collecting a key instantly unlocks any corresponding doors, regardless of the vault in which the key or door is found.

For example, in the map above, the top-left robot first collects key `a`, unlocking door A in the bottom-right vault:
```
#######
#@.#Cd#
##.#@##
#######
##@#@##
#cB#.b#
#######
```
Then, the bottom-right robot collects key `b`, unlocking door `B` in the bottom-left vault:
```
#######
#@.#Cd#
##.#@##
#######
##@#.##
#c.#.@#
#######
```
Then, the bottom-left robot collects key `c`:
```
#######
#@.#.d#
##.#@##
#######
##.#.##
#@.#.@#
#######
```
Finally, the top-right robot collects key `d`:
```
#######
#@.#.@#
##.#.##
#######
##.#.##
#@.#.@#
#######
```
In this example, it only took **8 steps** to collect all of the keys.

Sometimes, multiple robots might have keys available, or a robot might have to wait for multiple keys to be collected:
```
###############
#d.ABC.#.....a#
######@#@######
###############
######@#@######
#b.....#.....c#
###############
```
First, the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right robots take turns collecting keys `a`, `b`, and `c`, a total of `6 + 6 + 6 = 18 steps`. Then, the top-left robot can access key `d`, spending another `6 steps`; collecting all of the keys here takes a minimum of `24 steps`.

Here's a more complex example:
```
#############
#DcBa.#.GhKl#
#.###@#@#I###
#e#d#####j#k#
###C#@#@###J#
#fEbA.#.FgHi#
#############
```
* Top-left robot collects key a.
* Bottom-left robot collects key b.
* Top-left robot collects key c.
* Bottom-left robot collects key d.
* Top-left robot collects key e.
* Bottom-left robot collects key f.
* Bottom-right robot collects key g.
* Top-right robot collects key h.
* Bottom-right robot collects key i.
* Top-right robot collects key j.
* Bottom-right robot collects key k.
* Top-right robot collects key l.

In the above example, the fewest steps to collect all of the keys is **32**.

Here's an example with more choices:
```
#############
#g#f.D#..h#l#
#F###e#E###.#
#dCba@#@BcIJ#
#############
#nK.L@#@G...#
#M###N#H###.#
#o#m..#i#jk.#
#############
```
One solution with the fewest steps is:

* Top-left robot collects key e.
* Top-right robot collects key h.
* Bottom-right robot collects key i.
* Top-left robot collects key a.
* Top-left robot collects key b.
* Top-right robot collects key c.
* Top-left robot collects key d.
* Top-left robot collects key f.
* Top-left robot collects key g.
* Bottom-right robot collects key k.
* Bottom-right robot collects key j.
* Top-right robot collects key l.
* Bottom-left robot collects key n.
* Bottom-left robot collects key m.
* Bottom-left robot collects key o.

This example requires at least **72** steps to collect all keys.

After updating your map and using the remote-controlled robots, **what is the fewest steps necessary to collect all of the keys**?

## Solution
The hardest part about this problem is wrapping your head around it. The maps are changed in a way so that no robot other than `robot1` can reach `a`, and no robot other than `robot2` can access `b`. *No key can be accessed by two or more robots*. The quadrants are blocked off in a way that robots can't go into other quadrants.

### Lower-bound / Good Guess

The first thing we do is get a lower-bound on the number of steps needed. I.e., we assume each robot has all doors that have their key belonging to other quadrants unlocked. E.g., if `robot1` has door `A` but key `a` belongs in `robot2`'s quadrant, we assume `A` is unlocked because `robot2` will get key `a` at some point eventually because it has to. **My answer from this lower-bound problem was the correct answer to my input!** As well as Greg's!

```typescript
export const lowerBound = (keytoKeyMap: Map<string, IKeyToKeyInfo[]>, entrances: Map<string, IPoint>) => {
    type QueueState = {totalSteps: number; keysObtained: string; atKey: string};
    const queue = new PriorityQueue<QueueState>(p => -1 * p.totalSteps);
    const visited = new Map<string, number>();
    const getReachableKeys = makeGetReachableKeys(keytoKeyMap);
    const keyToQuadrantMap = getKeyToEntranceMap(keytoKeyMap, entrances); // The entrance a key belongs to
    // all the keys that will be obtained in a quadrant.
    const allKeysInQuadrant = new Map(Array.from(entrances.keys()).map(k => [
        k, // key of the Map
        keytoKeyMap.get(k)!.map(k1 => k1.toKey).join('')
    ]));
    const keysPerQuadrant = new Map(Array.from(entrances.keys()).map(k => [k, keytoKeyMap.get(k)!.length]));
    const minSteps = new Map(Array.from(entrances.keys()).map(k => [k, Infinity]));

    for (const e of entrances.keys())
        queue.enqueue({totalSteps: 0, keysObtained: '', atKey: e});

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        const { totalSteps, keysObtained, atKey } = queue.dequeue()!;
        const quadrant = keyToQuadrantMap.get(atKey)!;

        if (keysObtained.length === keysPerQuadrant.get(quadrant)) {
            const currMinSteps = minSteps.get(quadrant)!;
            minSteps.set(quadrant, Math.min(currMinSteps, totalSteps));
        }

        const keysObtainedOtherQuadrants = getAllValuesExcludingKey(quadrant, allKeysInQuadrant);
        const keysObtainedSet = new GenericSet(k => k, [...keysObtained, ...keysObtainedOtherQuadrants]);
        const reachableKeys = getReachableKeys(atKey, keysObtainedSet);

        for (const key of reachableKeys) {
            const newKeysObtained = keysObtained + key.toKey;
            const newCacheKey = getCacheKey(key.toKey, newKeysObtained);
            const newTotalSteps = totalSteps + key.steps;
            if (!visited.has(newCacheKey) || visited.get(newCacheKey)! > newTotalSteps) {
                queue.enqueue({
                    totalSteps: totalSteps + key.steps,
                    atKey: key.toKey,
                    keysObtained: newKeysObtained
                });
                visited.set(newCacheKey, newTotalSteps);
            }
        }
    }
    return Array.from(minSteps.values()).reduce((a, c) => a + c, 0);
};
```

The lower-bound above isn't always correct. E.g., for the following maze:

```
[4, 36steps]
###########
#.DeE#aB..#
#.#######.#
#...@#@...#
###########
#cA.@#@...#
####.####.#
#b...#dC..#
###########
```
It returns **34 steps**, because the bottom-left quadrant assumes it'll have door `A` unlocked sometime in the future, so it goes `@ -> c -> b`, when really, it needs to go `@ -> b -> c` because then will it be able to unlock door `B` for top-right quadant, and so on. The right answer is **36 steps**.

### Always Correct Solution
It helps to visualize the problem with just two robots first. So imagine if there were only two robots: `@` and `@1`. The reachable key for `@` are `[]` and reachable keys for `@1` are `[a, b]` with steps `[10, 3]`, respectively. Thus, we have the following two possible options:
* `(@, a)` - `robot0` stays where it's at because its the only option it can take, and `robot1` goes to key `a`, unlocking door `A` when it gets popped from queue. This will cost us **10 steps**.
* `(@, b)` - `robot0` stays where it's at, and `robot1` goes to key `b`, unlocking door `B` when it gets popped from queue. This will cost us **3 steps**.

Now imagine the `queue` pops the robot positions `(@, b)`, implying `robot0` is at `@` and `robot1` is at `b`, and door `B` is unlocked, with a total cost of 3 steps.

We again get the reachable keys for both robots, and now the reachable keys are:
* `robot0` = `[u, v]` with steps `[4, 40]`
* `robot1` = `[c]` with steps `[10]`.

Now the possible routes we have are:
* ~~`(@, b)`~~ - This option implies both robots stay where they're at, which would lead to an infinite loop, so this is **not** an option.
* `(@, c)` - `robot0` stays, `robot1` advances.
* `(u, b)` - `robot0` advances, `robot1` stays.
* `(u, c)` - both robots advance.
* `(v, b)` - `robot0` advances, `robot1` stays.
* `(v, c)` - both robots advance.

All of those options get put into the queue! E.g., the option `(u, c)` will get put into the queue with a total step of `3 + 4 + 10 = 17`, and `keysObtained = b,u,c`.

We keep dequeueing and enqueueing the queue until we get all keys obtained.
