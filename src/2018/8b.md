# Day 8: Memory Manuever - [Part 2](8b.ts)
The second check is slightly more complicated: you need to find the value of the root node (`A` in the example above).

The **value of a node** depends on whether it has child nodes.

If a node has **no child nodes**, its value is the sum of its metadata entries. So, the value of node `B` is `10+11+12=33`, and the value of node `D` is `99`.

However, if a node **does have child nodes**, the metadata entries become indexes which refer to those child nodes. A metadata entry of `1` refers to the first child node, `2` to the second, `3` to the third, and so on. The value of this node is the sum of the values of the child nodes referenced by the metadata entries. If a referenced child node does not exist, that reference is skipped. A child node can be referenced multiple time and counts each time it is referenced. A metadata entry of `0` does not refer to any child node.

For example,
```
2 3 0 3 10 11 12 1 1 0 1 99 2 1 1 2
A-----------------------------=====
    B---======== C----------=
                     D---==
```

* Node `C` has one metadata entry, `2`. Because node `C` has only one child node, 2 references a child node which does not exist, and so the value of node C is 0.
* Node `A` has three metadata entries: `1`, `1`, and `2`. The `1` references node `A`'s first child node, `B`, and the `2` references node `A`'s second child node, `C`. Because node `B` has a value of `33` and node `C` has a value of `0`, the value of node `A` is `33+33+0=66`.

So, in this example, the value of the root node is `66`.

What is the value of the root node?

## Solution
We first have to generalize our N-ary tree so that its `metadata` is a generic type, because this time we **don't** want to sum up the metadata values: we want to keep them as an array.

E.g., for 
```
2 3 0 3 10 11 12 1 1 0 1 99 2 1 1 2
A-----------------------------=====
    B---======== C----------=
                     D---==
```
Instead of `INode<number>`:
```
4
├──33
└──2
   └──99
```
We want `INode<number[]>`:
```
1,1,2
├──10,11,12
└──2
   └──99
```

Our N-ary class is introduced:

```typescript
export interface INode<T> {
    children: INode<T>[];
    metadata: T;
}

interface IBaseNode {
    toString(): string;
}

export class NaryTree<T extends IBaseNode> {
    public root: INode<T> | null;

    constructor(root: INode<T> | null = null) {
        this.root = root;
    }

    // type T is the type of the input,
    // type E is the type you want for metadata
    static from<T, E>(arr: T[], addToMeta: (a: E, b: T) => E, nil: E) {
        const helper = (startIndex: number): {node: INode<E>; nextIndex: number} => {
            const node: INode<E> = {
                children: [],
                metadata: nil
            };
            const numOfChildren = arr[startIndex] ?? 0;
            const numOfMeta = arr[startIndex + 1] ?? 0;
            let childIndex = startIndex + 2;

            for (let i = 0; i < numOfChildren && childIndex < arr.length; i++) {
                const childResult = helper(childIndex);
                childIndex = childResult.nextIndex;
                node.children.push(childResult.node);
            }

            for (let i = 0; i < numOfMeta && childIndex < arr.length; i++) {
                node.metadata = addToMeta(node.metadata, arr[childIndex++]);
            }
            return {
                node,
                nextIndex: childIndex
            };
        };
        return new NaryTree(helper(0).node);
    }
}
```

Which we then use as

```typescript
const list = [2, 3, 0, 3, 10, 11, 12, 1, 1, 0, 1, 99, 2, 1, 1, 2];
const tree = NaryTree.from<number, number[]>(list, (a, b) => [...a, b], []);
```

or like this for part a:

```typescript
const tree = NaryTree.from<number, number>(list, (a, b) => a + b, 0);
```

Finally, our recursive function to get this sum is pretty straightforward:

```typescript
const getSum = (list: number[]) => {
    const tree = NaryTree.from<number, number[]>(list, (a, b) => [...a, b], []);
    const helper = (node: INode<number[]>): number => {
        if (node.children.length === 0)
            return node.metadata.reduce((a, c) => a + c, 0);

        let sum = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < node.metadata.length; i++)
            if (node.metadata[i] <= node.children.length)
                sum += helper(node.children[node.metadata[i] - 1]);
        return sum;
    };

    return tree.root == null ? 0 : helper(tree.root);
};
```
