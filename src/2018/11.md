# Day 11: Chronal Charge - [Part 1](11.ts) & [Part 2](11b.ts)
The low fuel warning light is illuminated on your wrist-mounted device. Tapping it once causes it to project a hologram of the situation: a **300x300** grid of fuel cells and their current power levels, some negative. You're not sure what negative power means in the context of time travel, but it can't be good.

Each fuel cell has a coordinate ranging **from 1 to 300** in both the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) direction. In `X,Y` notation, the top-left cell is `1,1`, and the top-right cell is `300,1`.

The interface lets you select **any 3x3 square** of fuel cells. To increase your chances of getting to your destination, you decide to choose the 3x3 square with the **largest total power**.

The power level in a given fuel cell can be found through the following process:
1. Find the fuel cell's **rack ID**, which is its **X coordinate plus 10**.
2. Begin with a power level of the **rack ID** times the **Y coordinate**.
3. Increase the power level by the value of the **grid serial number** (your puzzle input).
4. Set the power level to itself multiplied by the **rack ID**.
5. Keep only the **hundreds digit** of the power level (so `12345` becomes `3`; numbers with no hundreds digit become `0`).
6. **Subtract 5** from the power level.

For example, to find the power level of the fuel cell at 3,5 in a grid with serial number `8`:

1. The rack ID is `3 + 10 = `**`13`**.
2. The power level starts at `13 * 5 = `**`65`**.
3. Adding the serial number produces `65 + 8 = `**`73`**.
4. Multiplying by the rack ID produces `73 * 13 = `**`949`**.
5. The hundreds digit of `94`**`9`** is **`9`**.
6. Subtracting 5 produces `9 - 5 = `**`4`**.

So, the power level of this fuel cell is **`4`**.

Here are some more example power levels:

* Fuel cell at  `122,79`, grid serial number `57`: power level `-5`.
* Fuel cell at `217,196`, grid serial number `39`: power level  `0`.
* Fuel cell at `101,153`, grid serial number `71`: power level  `4`.

Your goal is to find the 3x3 square which has the largest total power. The square must be entirely within the 300x300 grid. Identify this square using the `X,Y` coordinate of its **top-left fuel cell**. For example:

For grid serial number `18`, the largest total 3x3 square has a top-left corner of **`33,45`** (with a total power of `29`); these fuel cells appear in the middle of this 5x5 region:
```
-2  -4   4   4   4
-4   4   4   4  -5
 4   3   3   4  -4
 1   1   2   4  -3
-1   0   2  -5  -2
```

For grid serial number `42`, the largest 3x3 square's top-left is **`21,61`** (with a total power of `30`); they are in the middle of this region:
```
-3   4   2   2   2
-4   4   3   3   4
-5   3   3   4  -4
 4   3   3   4  -3
 3   3   3  -5  -1
```
**What is the X,Y coordinate of the top-left fuel cell of the 3x3 square with the largest total power?**

Your puzzle answer was 235,85.

### Part 2
You discover a dial on the side of the device; it seems to let you select a square of **any size**, not just 3x3. Sizes from 1x1 to 300x300 are supported.

Realizing this, you now must find the **square of any size with the largest total power**. Identify this square by including its size as a third parameter after the top-left coordinate: a 9x9 square with a top-left corner of `3,5` is identified as `3,5,9`.

For example:

* For grid serial number `18`, the largest total square (with a total power of `113`) is 16x16 and has a top-left corner of 90,269, so its identifier is **`90,269,16`**.
* For grid serial number 42, the largest total square (with a total power of 119) is 12x12 and has a top-left corner of 232,251, so its identifier is **`232,251,12`**.

**What is the X,Y,size identifier of the square with the largest total power?**

## Solution
The only thing common between the two parts is:

```typescript
export interface ISize {
    width: number;
    height: number;
}

export const makeGetPower = (serial: number) => ({row, col}: IPoint) => {
    const rackId = col + 10;
    let power = row * rackId + serial;
    power *= rackId;
    power = Math.trunc(power / 100) % 10;
    return power - 5;
};
```

### Part 1
I brute-forced it. I computed the power levels for all 90,000 squares (300x300), stored it in a `Map`, and used that to find the optimal `3x3` square.

To generate the `Map`:
```typescript
export const getPowerLevels = (grid: ISize, serial: number) => {
    const powerLevels = new Map<string, number>();
    const getPower = makeGetPower(serial);
    for (let i = 1; i <= grid.height; i++)
        for (let j = 1; j <= grid.width; j++) {
            const p = {row: i, col: j};
            powerLevels.set(toKey(p), getPower(p));
        }
    return powerLevels;
};
```

To get the total power within a small `square` (of 3x3) given the the `powerLevels Map` from above, and the `starting` position:
```typescript
const makeGetTotalPower =
    (square: ISize, powerLevels: Map<string, number>) =>
    (starting: IPoint) =>
{
    let totalPower = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < square.height; i++)
        for (let j = 0; j < square.width; j++)
            totalPower += powerLevels.get(toKey(add(starting)({row: i, col: j})))!;
    return totalPower;
};
```

And finally, to find the maximum total power in the `300x300`:

```typescript
export const makeGetLargestPower = (grid: ISize, serial: number) => {
    const powerLevels = getPowerLevels(grid, serial);

    return (square: ISize) => {
        let maxPower = -1;
        let maxPowerPoint = {row: 0, col: 0};
        const getTotalPower = makeGetTotalPower(square, powerLevels);
        for (let i = 1; i <= grid.height - square.height; i++) {
            for (let j = 1; j <= grid.width - square.width; j++) {
                const p = {row: i, col: j};
                const curr = getTotalPower(p);
                if (curr > maxPower) {
                    maxPower = curr;
                    maxPowerPoint = p;
                }
            }
        }
        return {
            coordinate: `${maxPowerPoint.col},${maxPowerPoint.row}`,
            power: maxPower
        };
    };
};
```

### Part 2
#### Attempt 1: Brute-force - <img src="/src/2018/tex/9bfb295f00e7aede3314e69b505c382f.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=43.02219404999999pt height=26.76175259999998pt/>
This solution just builds off of part 1:
```typescript
export const getLargestPowerAndSize = (serial: number) => {
    const getLargestPower = makeGetLargestPower({height: 300, width: 300}, serial);
    let maxPower = {coordinate: 'null', power: -1};
    let maxSize = 1;

    for (let size = 1; size <= 300; size++) {
        console.log(`at size = ${size}`);
        const currPower = getLargestPower({height: size, width: size});
        if (currPower.power > maxPower.power) {
            maxPower = currPower;
            maxSize = size;
        }
    }

    return `${maxPower.coordinate},${maxSize}`;
};
```

How is it <img src="/src/2018/tex/9bfb295f00e7aede3314e69b505c382f.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=43.02219404999999pt height=26.76175259999998pt/>? We know that `makeGetLargestPower` is providing the <img src="/src/2018/tex/3987120c67ed5a9162aa9841b531c3a9.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=43.02219404999999pt height=26.76175259999998pt/> like it did in part 1, but the `makeGetTotalPower` from part 1 and `getLargestPowerAndSize` from part 2 have a runtime of:

```
size = 1        makeGetTotalPower = 1^2
size = 2        makeGetTotalPower = 2^2
size = 3        makeGetTotalPower = 3^2
...
size = 300      makeGetTotalPower = 300^2
```
