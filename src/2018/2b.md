# Day 2b: Similar Words - [Code](2b.ts)
Given an array of `ids`, find the first two ids that differ by **exactly one** character at the same position in both strings.

Example:
```
abcde
fghij
klmno
pqrst
fguij
axcye
wvxyz
```

The IDs `abcde` and `axcye` are close, but they differ by two characters (the second and fourth). However, the IDs `fghij` and `fguij` differ by exactly one character, the third (h and u). Those must be the correct boxes.

**What letters are common between the two correct box IDs**? (In the example above, this is found by removing the differing character from either ID, producing `fgij`.)

## Solution
Convert each word to its *generic form*. I.e., for the word `abcde`, create `[*bcde, a*cde, ab*de, abc*e, abcd*]`, and store that in a map. Scan each word one at a time, creating a generic form for every letter in that word. Keep a count in the dictionary. Once the count becomes greater than `1`, return the generic form without the `*`.

```typescript
const getNthGenericForm = (id: string, n: number) =>
    id.substring(0, n) + '*' + id.substring(n + 1);

export const corpusToGeneric = (ids: string[]) => {
    const map = new Map<string, number>();

    for (let i = 0; i < ids.length; i++)
        for (let j = 0; j < ids[i].length; j++) {
            const generic = getNthGenericForm(ids[i], j);
            map.set(generic, (map.get(generic) ?? 0) + 1);
            if (map.get(generic)! > 1)
                return generic.replace(/\*/, '');
        }
    return map;
};
```

For the example above, this produces:

```
Map {
  '*bcde' => 1,
  'a*cde' => 1,
  'ab*de' => 1,
  'abc*e' => 1,
  'abcd*' => 1,
  '*ghij' => 1,
  'f*hij' => 1,
  'fg*ij' => 2,
  'fgh*j' => 1,
  'fghi*' => 1,
  '*lmno' => 1,
  'k*mno' => 1,
  'kl*no' => 1,
  'klm*o' => 1,
  'klmn*' => 1,
  '*qrst' => 1,
  'p*rst' => 1,
  'pq*st' => 1,
  'pqr*t' => 1,
  'pqrs*' => 1,
  '*guij' => 1,
  'f*uij' => 1,
  'fgu*j' => 1,
  'fgui*' => 1,
  '*xcye' => 1,
  'a*cye' => 1,
  'ax*ye' => 1,
  'axc*e' => 1,
  'axcy*' => 1,
  '*vxyz' => 1,
  'w*xyz' => 1,
  'wv*yz' => 1,
  'wvx*z' => 1,
  'wvxy*' => 1
}
```
