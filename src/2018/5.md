# Day 5: Polymer Reactions - [Part1](5.ts) and [Part2](5b.ts)
Polymer is formed by smaller **units** which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by **letters**; units' polarity is represented by **capitalization**. For instance, `r` and `R` are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas `r` and `s` are entirely different types and do not react.

For example:

* In `aA`, `a` and `A` react, leaving nothing behind.
* In `abBA`, `bB` destroys itself, leaving `aA`. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.
* In `abAB`, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.
* In `aabAAB`, even though `aa` and `AA` are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.

Now, consider a larger example, `dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA`:

```
dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.
dabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.
dabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).
dabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.
```

After all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains **10 units**.

### Part 1
How many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned?

### Part 2
One of the unit types is causing problems; it's preventing the polymer from collapsing as much as it should. Your goal is to figure out which unit type is causing the most problems, remove all instances of it (regardless of polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its length.

For example, again using the polymer `dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA` from above:

* Removing all `A`/`a` units produces `dbcCCBcCcD`. Fully reacting this polymer produces `dbCBcD`, which has length `6`.
* Removing all `B`/`b` units produces `daAcCaCAcCcaDA`. Fully reacting this polymer produces `daCAcaDA`, which has length `8`.
* Removing all `C`/`c` units produces `dabAaBAaDA`. Fully reacting this polymer produces `daDA`, which has length `4`.
* Removing all `D`/`d` units produces `abAcCaCBAcCcaA`. Fully reacting this polymer produces `abCBAc`, which has length `6`.

In this example, removing all `C`/`c` units was **best**, producing the answer `4`.

What is the length of the shortest polymer you can produce by removing all units of exactly one type and fully reacting the result?

## Solution
There are two ways of solving this, a slow way and a fast way.

Both solutions rely on this function:

```typescript
// 'a' and 'A', and any other letter with opposite casing,
// will always have a diff of 32.
export const willReact = (c1: string, c2: string) =>
    Math.abs(c2.charCodeAt(0) - c1.charCodeAt(0)) === 32;
```

Let's look at the suboptimal solution first.

### Suboptimal Solution
```typescript
export const destroy =
    (polymer: string) =>
    (index: number) =>
        polymer.substring(0, index - 1) + polymer.substring(index + 1);

const react = (polymer: string) => {
    let result = polymer,
        index = 1;
    while (index < result.length) {
        if (willReact(result.charAt(index), result.charAt(index - 1))) {
            result = destroy(result)(index);
            index--;
        }
        else {
            index++;
        }
    }
    return result;
};
```

This solution goes and recreates a new string every time, which takes `O(n)` time, and so doing that `n` times gives you a `O(n^2)` solution. On my [input](5.txt) for part 2, this solution has a runtime of **4 seconds**.

### Optimal Solution
A better solution is to use a **stack**. If the last element in the stack will react with the current element in the polymer, `pop()` the stack. 

```typescript
const react2 = (polymer: string) => {
    const result = [''];
    let index = 0;
    while (index < polymer.length) {
        const char = polymer.charAt(index);
        if (willReact(last(result), char))
            result.pop();
        else
            result.push(char);
        index++;
    }
    // -1 because we added an empty string ('') in the
    // beginning so that last(result) doesn't return undefined
    return result.length - 1;
};
```
This has a time complexity of `O(n)`. On my [input](5.txt) for part 2, this solution has a runtime of **100ms**.

### Part 2
Just repeatedly do `part 1` while also doing an `exclusion` check.

One awesome optimization is to first do part 1 to get a `smallerPolymer`, and then when looping through the alphabets, use this new `smallerPolymer`.

### Doesn't call `react()` first (`100ms` runtime)

```typescript
const react = (polymer: string) => (exclude: string) => {
    const result = [''];
    let index = 0;
    while (index < polymer.length) {
        const char = polymer.charAt(index);
        if (willReact(last(result), char))
            result.pop();
        else if (char.toUpperCase() !== exclude)
            result.push(char);
        index++;
    }
    return result.length - 1;
};

const reactWithImprovements = (polymer: string) => {
    const begin = 'A'.charCodeAt(0);
    const end = 'Z'.charCodeAt(0);
    let shortestPolymer = Infinity;
    for (let i = begin; i <= end; i++)
        shortestPolymer = Math.min(
            shortestPolymer,
            react(polymer)(String.fromCharCode(i))
        );
    return shortestPolymer;
};
```

### Calls `react()` first (`40ms` runtime)
```typescript
const react = (polymer: string) => (exclude: string) => {
    const result: string[] = [];
    let index = 0;
    while (index < polymer.length) {
        const char = polymer.charAt(index);
        if (willReact(last(result) ?? '', char))
            result.pop();
        else if (char.toUpperCase() !== exclude)
            result.push(char);
        index++;
    }
    return result;
};

const reactWithImprovements = (polymer: string) => {
    const begin = 'A'.charCodeAt(0);
    const end = 'Z'.charCodeAt(0);
    let shortestPolymer = Infinity;

    const smallerPolymer = react(polymer)('').join('');
    for (let i = begin; i <= end; i++)
        shortestPolymer = Math.min(
            shortestPolymer,
            react(smallerPolymer)(String.fromCharCode(i)).length
        );
    return shortestPolymer;
};
```
