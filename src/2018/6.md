# Day 6: Chronal Coordinates - [Part 1](6.ts) & [Part 2](6b.ts)
Using only the Manhattan distance, determine the **area** around each coordinate by counting the number of integer X,Y locations that are **closest** to that coordinate (and aren't tied in distance to any other coordinate).

Your goal is to find the size of the **largest area** that isn't infinite. For example, consider the following list of coordinates:
```
1, 1
1, 6
8, 3
3, 4
5, 5
8, 9
```
If we name these coordinates `A` through `F`, we can draw them on a grid, putting `0,0` at the top left:
```
..........
.A........
..........
........C.
...D......
.....E....
.B........
..........
..........
........F.
```

This view is partial - the actual grid extends infinitely in all directions. Using the Manhattan distance, each location's closest coordinate can be determined, shown here in lowercase:
```
aaaaa.cccc
aAaaa.cccc
aaaddecccc
aadddeccCc
..dDdeeccc
bb.deEeecc
bBb.eeee..
bbb.eeefff
bbb.eeffff
bbb.ffffFf
```
Locations shown as `.` are equally far from two or more coordinates, and so **they don't count** as being closest to any.

In this example, the areas of coordinates A, B, C, and F are infinite - while not shown here, their areas extend forever outside the visible grid. However, the areas of coordinates D and E are finite: D is closest to 9 locations, and E is closest to 17 (both including the coordinate's location itself). Therefore, in this example, the size of the largest area is **17**.

**What is the size of the largest area that isn't infinite?**

## Part 2
Find a **region** near as many coordinates as possible.

For example, suppose you want the sum of the Manhattan distance to all of the coordinates to be less than **32**. For each location, add up the distances to all of the given coordinates; if the total of those distances is less than 32, that location is within the desired region. Using the same coordinates as above, the resulting region looks like this:
```
..........
.A........
..........
...###..C.
..#D###...
..###E#...
.B.###....
..........
..........
........F.
```

The `#` represent locations where the distance to all coordinates (`A` to `F`) is less than 32. There are **16** `#`s. (One is on the same location as `D` and the other is on `E`). E.g., for for location `(x,y) = (4,3)` (top center `#`), the total distance is:

* Distance to coordinate A: `abs(4-1) + abs(3-1) =  5`
* Distance to coordinate B: `abs(4-1) + abs(3-6) =  6`
* Distance to coordinate C: `abs(4-8) + abs(3-3) =  4`
* Distance to coordinate D: `abs(4-3) + abs(3-4) =  2`
* Distance to coordinate E: `abs(4-5) + abs(3-5) =  3`
* Distance to coordinate F: `abs(4-8) + abs(3-9) = 10`
* Total distance: `5 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 10 = 30`

**What is the size of the region containing all locations which have a total distance to all given coordinates of less than 10000?**

## Solution
### Part 1
* Name each coordinate from `AA` to `ZZ`.
* Get the bounds of the coordinates. I.e., find `[minX, maxX]` and `[minY, maxY]`.
* Do a BFS expansion from each coordinate:
    * If a coordinate goes out of bounds, consider it an infinite coordinate, don't expand from the current point (otherwise you'll get more into infinity), but continue expanding from the coordinate.
    * If the coordinante lands on point `c` that's visited,
        * If the distance on point `c` is less than the current distance, don't expand from here.
        * If the distance is same and it's not marked as `.`, mark it as `.` and deduct `regionSize` from the existing coordinate on `c`.

    'A'.charCodeAt(0) + Math.trunc(i / 26),
    'A'.charCodeAt(0) + i % 26
);

const getBounds = (points: IPoint[]): IBound => {

    const { row, col } = p;
    const { rowBounds: [minR, maxR], colBounds: [minC, maxC] } = bounds;
    if (row < minR || row > maxR || col < minC || col > maxC)
        return false;
    return true;
};

```

BFS Search:
```typescript
const getFiniteAreas = (points: INamedPoint[]) => {
    const queue = new Queue<INamedPoint & {distance: number}>();
    const visited = new Map<string, {name: string; distance: number}>(); // point -> name&distance
    const isInBounds = makeIsInBounds(getBounds(points));
    const areaPerCoordinate = new Map<string, number>(points.map(p => [p.name, 0])); // name -> regionSize
    const hasInfiniteArea = new Set<string>();

    points.forEach(p => queue.enqueue({...p, distance: 0}));

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        const { distance, name, ...p } = queue.dequeue()!;
        const pointStr = toKey(p);

        if (!visited.has(pointStr)) {
            visited.set(pointStr, {name, distance});
            areaPerCoordinate.set(name, (areaPerCoordinate.get(name) ?? 0) + 1);
        }
        else {
            const {
                name: contenderName, distance: contenderDistance
            } = visited.get(pointStr)!;
            if (contenderDistance < distance || contenderName === excludedName || contenderName === name)
                continue;
            // if both are equidistance, put a '.' on the spot, and subtract that point
            // from the name currently on it
            else if (contenderDistance === distance) {
                visited.set(pointStr, {name: excludedName, distance});
                areaPerCoordinate.set(contenderName, areaPerCoordinate.get(contenderName)! - 1);
                continue;
            }
            // the case of contenderDistance > distance shouldn't happen, because otherwise it
            // would've been popped
        }

        let neighbors = getNeighbors(p);
        if (!neighbors.every(isInBounds))
            hasInfiniteArea.add(name);

        neighbors = neighbors.filter(isInBounds).filter(p => !visited.has(toKey(p)));
        for (const neighbor of neighbors)
            queue.enqueue({...neighbor, name, distance: distance + 1});
    }

    return new Map(Array.from(areaPerCoordinate.entries()).filter(e => !hasInfiniteArea.has(e[0])));
};

const getLargestFiniteArea = (map: Map<string, number>) => Math.max(...Array.from(map.values()));
```

### Part 2
* The minimum distance to all coordinates is at the **center** of all points, which is obtained by getting the average of the `x`'s and `y`'s.
* Start a BFS or a DFS expansion from the center: expand all points that produce a distance of less than `10,000` and have not been visited.

    (p: IPoint) =>
        points.reduce((a, c) => a + getDistance(p, c), 0);

const getCenter = (points: IPoint[]) => ({
    // avg betw all points is min distance - it's the center of all points
    row: Math.round(points.reduce((a, c) => a + c.row, 0) / points.length),
