# Day 19: Not Enough Minerals

Your scans show that the lava did indeed form obsidian!

The wind has changed direction enough to stop sending lava droplets toward you, so you and the elephants exit the cave. As you do, you notice a collection of geodes around the pond. Perhaps you could use the obsidian to create some **geode-cracking robots** and break them open?

To collect the obsidian from the bottom of the pond, you'll need waterproof **obsidian-collecting robots.** Fortunately, there is an abundant amount of clay nearby that you can use to make them waterproof.

In order to harvest the clay, you'll need special-purpose **clay-collecting robots.** To make any type of robot, you'll need ore, which is also plentiful but in the opposite direction from the clay.

Collecting ore requires **ore-collecting robots** with big drills. Fortunately, you have **exactly one ore-collecting robot** in your pack that you can use to kickstart the whole operation.

Each robot can collect 1 of its resource type per minute. It also takes one minute for the robot factory (also conveniently from your pack) to construct any type of robot, although it consumes the necessary resources available when construction begins.

The robot factory has many **blueprints** (your puzzle input) you can choose from, but once you've configured it with a blueprint, you can't change it. You'll need to work out which blueprint is best.

For example:

```
Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.

Blueprint 2:
  Each ore robot costs 2 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 3 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.
```

(Blueprints have been line-wrapped here for legibility. The robot factory's actual assortment of blueprints are provided one blueprint per line.)

The elephants are starting to look hungry, so you shouldn't take too long; you need to figure out which blueprint would maximize the number of opened geodes after **24 minutes** by figuring out which robots to build and when to build them.

Using blueprint 1 in the example above, the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 minutes is **9**. One way to achieve that is:

```

However, by using blueprint 2 in the example above, you could do even better: the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 minutes is 12.

Determine the **quality level** of each blueprint by multiplying that blueprint's ID number with the largest number of geodes that can be opened in 24 minutes using that blueprint. In this example, the first blueprint has ID 1 and can open 9 geodes, so its quality level is 9. The second blueprint has ID 2 and can open 12 geodes, so its quality level is 24. Finally, if you add up the quality levels of all of the blueprints in the list, you get **33**.

Determine the quality level of each blueprint using the largest number of geodes it could produce in 24 minutes. **What do you get if you add up the quality level of all of the blueprints in your list?**

Your puzzle answer was 1115.

## Part Two

While you were choosing the best blueprint, the elephants found some food on their own, so you're not in as much of a hurry; you figure you probably have **32 minutes** before the wind changes direction again and you'll need to get out of range of the erupting volcano.

Unfortunately, one of the elephants **ate most of your blueprint list!** Now, only the first three blueprints in your list are intact.

In 32 minutes, the largest number of geodes blueprint 1 (from the example above) can open is **56.**

However, blueprint 2 from the example above is still better; using it, the largest number of geodes you could open in 32 minutes is **62.**

You no longer have enough blueprints to worry about quality levels. Instead, for each of the first three blueprints, determine the largest number of geodes you could open; then, multiply these three values together.

Don't worry about quality levels; instead, just determine the largest number of geodes you could open using each of the first three blueprints. **What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?**

Your puzzle answer was 25056.

## Solution

We'll solve this in Python using Linear Programming, and then again in
Typescript using DFS with some heuristics.

### Python Integer Programming - [Code](../../python/2022/19.py)

See the Python setup in [README](../../README.md) and intro of this in [2020 day
21](../2020/21.md).

#### Formulation

##### Indices

- $t\in T$ - a specific time interval
- $Type = {Ore, Clay, Obsidian}$ - Set of types available
- $j\in Type$
- $i\in Type$

##### Parameters

- `T` - number of minutes to run the blueprint
- $c_ij$ - How many `j`s you need to build `i`, where $i\in Type$ and $j\in Type$. This is determined based on blueprint.

##### Variables

$$
\begin{flalign}
& \text{Ore}\_{t} = \text{Amount of ores available at time t}. &
\end{flalign}
$$

- Similar variables exist for $\text{Clay}_t$, $\text{Obsidian}_t$, $\text{Geode}_t$.

$$
\begin{flalign}
& \text{OreRobot}_{t} = \text{Number of ore robots you have at time t}. &
\end{flalign}
$$

- Similar variables exist for $\text{ClayRobot}_t$, $\text{ObsidianRobot}_t$, and $\text{GeodeRobot}_t$.

$$
\begin{flalign}
& \text{OreRobotBuilt}_{t} = \left\lbrace\matrix{1&\text{if an ore robot was built at time t} \cr 0&\text{otherwise}}\right. &
\end{flalign}
$$

- Similar variables exist for $\text{ClayRobotBuilt}_t$, $\text{ObsidianRobotBuilt}_t$, and $\text{GeodeRobotBuilt}_t$.

##### Objective

$$
\begin{flalign}
& \max{z} = \text{Geode}_T. &
\end{flalign}
$$

Maximize the number of geode resources available at the end, which is `t = T`.

##### Constraints

1. Ores at time `t` is equal to ores `t - 1` plus number of ore robots at `t - 1` minus all the ores used at time `t`.

$$
\forall_t \text{Ore}_t = \text{Ore}_{t-1} + \text{OreRobot}_{t-1} - c_{ore,ore}\times\text{OreRobotBuilt}_{t} - c_{clay,ore}\times\text{ClayRobotBuilt}_t - c_{obsidian,ore}\times\text{ObsidianRobotBuilt}_t - c_{geode,ore}\times\text{GeodeRobotBuilt}_t
$$

2. Ores built at time `t` is equal to ores built at `t - 1` + robots built at `t - 1`.

$$
\forall_t \space\space\space\space\space\space\space \text{OreRobot}_t = \text{OreRobot}_{t-1} + \text{OreRobotBuilt}_{t-1}
$$

3. One robot can be built per time `t`.

$$
\forall_t \space\space\space\space\space\space\space \text{OreRobotBuilt}_t + \text{ClayRobotBuilt}_t + \text{ObsidianRobotBuilt}_t + \text{GeodeRobotBuilt}_t <= 1
$$

#### Code

### Typescript Solution - [Code](./19.ts)

The solution is a depth-first search (DFS) with some heuristics that eliminate
some of the search space for us.

Here's a few interfaces to guide us there.

```typescript
interface Cost {
  ore: number;
  clay: number;
  obsidian: number;
}

interface Blueprint {
  oreRobot: Cost;
  clayRobot: Cost;
  obsidianRobot: Cost;
  geodeRobot: Cost;
}

interface State {
  resourcesAvailable: {
    ore: number;
    clay: number;
    obsidian: number;
    geode: number;
  };
  robots: {
    ore: number;
    clay: number;
    obsidian: number;
    geode: number;
  };
}
```

#### Heuristic 1

Don't explore a path if the maximum potential geode we could get from this path
is fewer than our current known maximum.

Here's a function that takes the current state and time remaining to determine
the maximum possible geodes.

```typescript
/**
 * Given there are N minutes left, what's the max number of geodes can you make
 * if you have infinite resources? It's the sum of
 *    * number of geodes you already have
 *    * number of geode robots you have * timeRemaining
 *        - E.g., if you have two robots and 5 remaining minutes, you'll make 10 geodes.
 *    * (timeRemaining-1) + (timeRemaining-2) + .. + 1
 *             = (timeRemaining) * (timeRemaining - 1) / 2
 *        - This is assuming you have infinite resources and you can build a
 *        geode every minute. If you have 2 miutes left, you can build a robot
 *        at t=2, and that robot can create 1 geode.
 *        - If you have 3 minutes left, you build a robot#1 at t=3, which would
 *        collect 2 geodes before time ran out. You build robot #2 at t=2, which
 *        would collect 1 geode.
 *        - With 4 minute left, you'd end up with 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 geode.
 *        - With N minute left, you'd end up with (N-1) + (N-2) + .. + 1 =
 *          N(N-1)/2 geodes.
 */
function potentialGeodes({
  timeRemaining,
  ...state
}: State & { timeRemaining: number }) {
  const futurePotential =
    timeRemaining <= 1 ? 0 : (timeRemaining * (timeRemaining - 1)) / 2;
  return (
    state.resourcesAvailable.geode +
    state.robots.geode * timeRemaining +
    futurePotential
  );
}
```

#### Heuristic 2

Say your blueprint says you need 1 ore to build ore robot, 2 for clay, 3 for
obsidian, and 4 for geode. These robots don't need any other resources to build
them.

If you already have 5 ores and 1 ore robot, there's no point exploring a path
that doesn't build any robots where you just collect more ores. There's nothing
to gain from hogging more ores. You can build any robot you want right now.

This heuristic eliminates paths that only collect resources if you have ample
resources. And ample resource is defined as when you have enough resources to
build any robot you want.

```typescript
/**
 * If you have enough resources to build any robot, don't bother with collecting
 * more resources (causing this function to return false). You should instead be
 * building bots + collecting resources at the same time.
 */
function addMoreResources(state: State, blueprint: Blueprint): boolean {
  const { ore, clay, obsidian } = state.resourcesAvailable;
  const { oreRobot, clayRobot, obsidianRobot, geodeRobot } = blueprint;
  if (
    ore <
    Math.max(oreRobot.ore, clayRobot.ore, obsidianRobot.ore, geodeRobot.ore)
  ) {
    return true;
  } else if (
    clay <
    Math.max(oreRobot.clay, clayRobot.clay, obsidianRobot.clay, geodeRobot.clay)
  ) {
    return true;
  } else if (
    obsidian <
    Math.max(
      oreRobot.obsidian,
      clayRobot.obsidian,
      obsidianRobot.obsidian,
      geodeRobot.obsidian
    )
  ) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```
