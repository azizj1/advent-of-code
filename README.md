# Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

#### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies via `yarn install`.
2. Two options:
   1. Run and watch a single file via `yarn watch-single`, or
   2. Run and watch the last file changed under a [specific year](src/watch-last-changed.ts) via `yarn start`.
