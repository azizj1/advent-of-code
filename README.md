Worth taking notes on:
* [Day 2b - System of Equations](src/2019/2b.md)
* Day 12 a and b
* Day 14 for sure!
* Day 15 - the trick with this is to not go backwards until you have to!
* [Day 18a - Robots Unlocking Keys and Doors](src/2019/18.md)
    * Dijkstra's algorithm
* [Day 18b - Multiple Robots Unlocking Keys and Doors](src/2019/18b.md)
    * Combinations with Dijkstra.
