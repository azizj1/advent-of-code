# Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

## Quick Start

### NodeJS

1. Install dependencies via `yarn install`.
2. Two options:
   1. Run and watch a single file via `yarn watch-single`, or
   2. Run and watch the last file changed under a [specific year](src/watch-last-changed.ts) via `yarn start`.

### Python

1. Change directory `cd python`.
1. Install `virtualenv` via `pip3 install virtualenv`.
1. Run `virtualenv ./env`.
1. Run `source ./env/bin/activate`.
1. Run `pip install -r py-requirements.txt`.
1. Run `nodemon --exec python 2022/19.py`.

# General problem solving tips

1. Try reducing the problem space down. If there's 10 valves, or 8 monkeys, or
   30 doors, etc. Imagine if there was just 1 or 2 valves or monkeys or doors.
   Solve that smaller problem space first.
2. Look at the input, make sure there isn't any shortcut you can take. Maybe
   some monkeys you'll never visit, or some doors that don't ever have to be
   opened, or some valves you don't have to release pressure on because flow is
   0, etc.
3. Transform the problem space. This came in handy for [2019 day
   18a](src/2019/18.md) and [2022 day 16](src/2022/16.md). Convert the problem
   into a graph, or an adjacency matrix, etc. that is much easier to work on
   because of fewer variables.
